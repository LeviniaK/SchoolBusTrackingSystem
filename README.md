## Project Description
The School Bus Tracking System is a real-time solution designed to help schools, parents, and bus drivers effectively track school buses, manage student boarding and exit, estimate arrival times, and notify about delays. This system utilizes GPS location data, route optimization, and time estimation algorithms to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Features
1. Track Bus Location: Real-time updates on the location of school buses.
2. Estimate Arrival Times: Calculates expected arrival times at each stop.
3. Student Management: Records boarding and exit of students.
4. Delay Notifications: Alerts parents and staff about delays in schedule.
5. Generate Reports: Provides reports for routes and bus performance.


## Technical Details

### Core Components
- Bus: Manages bus details such as ID, driver name, assigned route, and current location.
- Student: Handles student details and their associated bus routes.
- Route: Manages stops, schedules, and distance calculations.
- Location: Handles GPS coordinates and timestamp for tracking.

### Implementation Details
- Real-time data handling with simulated GPS coordinates.
- Time estimation algorithms for calculating arrival times.
- Multiple array manipulations for route management and student tracking.
- Error handling to manage unexpected scenarios like GPS failures.

## Installation and Usage

### Pre-requisites
1. Java Development Kit(JDK) 17
2. Vs Code
3. JUnit 4.13.2 for testing.
